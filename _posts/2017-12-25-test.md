How to make Space Shuttle work in X-Plane 12? 

Space Shuttle is not included in X-Plane 12 but is in X-Plane 11. To fly Space Shuttle in X-Plane 12, you can follow the steps below.

- Download and install (at least demo version) of X-Plane 11.
- Install X-Plane 11.
- Copy the folder in X-Plane 11/Aircraft/Extra Aircraft/Space Shuttle and paste it to a new location in X-Plane 12, e.g., X-Plane 12/Aircraft/Extra Aircraft/.
- Open Plane Maker in X-Plane 11 folder. From Plane Maker, open  X-Plane 11/Aircraft/Extra Aircraft/Space Shuttle/Orbiter.acf and save it to X-Plane 12/Aircraft/Extra Aircraft/Space Shuttle/Orbiter.acf. This step is necessary because X-Plane 12 does not recognize the original Orbiter.acf file in X-Plane 11 folder.
- Now, open X-Plane 12, you should be able to see Space Shuttle in your aircrafts.
